# Changelog

All notable changes to PayneSDD are documented here.
Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## 0.1.0 — 2026-06-01

First public release.

### Added
- `AGENT.md` — the core operating protocol (Steps 0–6: contract → interrogate &
  depth → plan-approval STOP → machine gate → adversarial pass → verdict), with
  the "verifier is not an oracle" rule and an explicit escalation budget.
- Optional "drill instructor" persona, with a hard dosage rule (substance first).
- `templates/SPEC.template.md` — fixed contract skeleton for Step 1.
- `hooks/payne-gate-core.sh` — portable gate engine: runs your test command,
  red = exit 1. Agent-agnostic.
- `hooks/payne-gate.sh` — Claude Code Stop-hook wrapper: "smart" mode (fires only
  when a `.payne-active` spec marker exists), blocks finishing on a red gate.
- `commands/payne-spec.md`, `commands/payne-review.md` — two Claude Code slash
  commands for Step 1 (start a contract) and Step 5 (adversarial review).
- `ROLES.md` — optional multi-agent overlay (Analyst→Product→Architect→Scrum
  Master→Developer→QA) mapped onto Steps 0–6, for large tasks only.
- `README.md`, `LICENSE` (MIT).

### Known limits (honest)
- **Not battle-tested.** Fresh project, no production mileage yet. Treat as a
  strong protocol, not a proven product.
- **Enforced gate is Claude-Code-only.** The Stop-hook auto-enforcement needs
  Claude Code. On other agents run `hooks/payne-gate-core.sh` on request — there
  the gate is advisory, not blocking.
